Calorie Tracker - Hackathon Submission
Team: Solo Builder
The Problem We Wanted to Solve
Supporting individuals in their wellness and fitness journeys (aligning with SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being) by providing a tool to easily track daily caloric intake. This empowers users to make informed dietary choices and regulate their consumption based on their personal health goals.

How We Built It
Tech Stack: This project was built using a modern, full-stack approach:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend & Database: Supabase for user authentication and data storage.

Payment Processing: Integrated the IntaSend API to handle subscription payments.

Development Tool: Built using the Cursor IDE for an AI-assisted development workflow.

The Plan: The architecture involved a frontend interface for user input, connected to a robust Supabase backend to securely save user data and meal entries. The IntaSend integration was implemented to handle premium features.

Challenges We Ran Into
This project was a significant learning experience, and we encountered several key challenges:

Tool Overload: This was my first time simultaneously working with Supabase, the IntaSend API, and the Cursor IDE. Integrating multiple new technologies in a short timeframe was complex and led to some initial confusion and context-switching.

Debugging Under Pressure: The debugging process became overwhelming at times. Isolating issues within new and unfamiliar systems felt like a rollercoaster, where attempted fixes occasionally created new, unexpected problems.

Time Management: I acknowledge that I started the project later than ideal within the 6-day window, which put significant pressure on the development and deployment phases.

What We Learned
What I Learned
The Pitfall of "Solution Stacking": I learned that integrating too many new technologies (Supabase, IntaSend, Cursor) simultaneously without deep prior knowledge in any of them can create a complex web of dependencies that is incredibly difficult to debug.

The Limits of AI-Assisted Debugging: I experienced firsthand how using ChatGPT for complex, multi-layered problems without a solid foundational understanding can lead to "solution regurgitation"â€”pasting code that addresses isolated errors but creates larger conflicts in the overall application architecture. This taught me that AI is a tool for assistance, not a replacement for core debugging and systems-thinking skills.

Resilience is a Skill: This project was a masterclass in perseverance through overwhelming technical confusion and frustration. The willingness to push through even when things are breaking in unexplainable ways is a critical developer trait.

What's Next for Calorie Tracker
Successfully resolve the deployment issues to get a live version running.

Add features like visual charts for calorie progress, a library of common foods, and goal setting.

Simplify the user interface based on feedback to make tracking even more intuitive.

Complete and test the premium subscription flow using the IntaSend integration.
